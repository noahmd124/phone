This is a website to convince my parents to get me a phone! It checks your IP, and if not an IP listed in the code, it hides the site with an access denied message (and it can't bypassed using DevTools). 
If correct, it also then takes you to an (unsecure) login page (the password is just stored in the code, but it I have used an obfuscator tool to scramble it a bit), and then to the homepage. Test it if you want! noahmd124.github.io/phone
