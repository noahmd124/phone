This is a website to convince my parents to get me a phone! It checks your IP, and if not an IP listed in the code, it hides the site with an access denied message (but it can be easily bypassed using DevTools).
If correct, it also then takes you to an (unsecure) login page (which can again be bypassed with DevTools!), and then to the homepage. Test it if you want! noahmd124.github.io/phone
